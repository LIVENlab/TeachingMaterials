#  We will be working with BW 2.5 (Note that the BW version you installed for Activity Browser is not the same. You need to install the correct version).

# As indicated in the BW2 installation site, you first need to install a distribution of python. Be sure to install python 3.11. More info:
# https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/content/installation/index.html
# https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# After you have python installed, we need to create a dedicated python environment and install Brightway 2.5 and other necessary packages.
# You can find all the packages needed in the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt
